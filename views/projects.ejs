                company.Using this web application makes the daunting task of maintaining inventory and invoices comparatively easy.It provides the option to send the invoices directly to the customer.<br>

                Whole project was handeled by me, from designing to coding to Database management.While compeleting this project i became familiar with the the MVC(Model,View and Controller) framework.<br><br>

                    This project was a bit different from other projects as we were already provided with the web application and we had to debug the code and solve the errors which were there and then do modifications.<br><br>
                    It was really helpul as it was very closely related to the situation which we are going to face in real world while working for any company.It helped me to understand the code written by other developers.
